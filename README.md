## Topic modelling and sentiment analysis of the political publications between 2015-2018 related to Migration

Data sources:
* Der Spiegel archive articles from the last 3 years

The goal is to extract publications related to Migration between these years and analyse how media has been treating the topic:
* Was there any change on the vocabulary used over the last years regarding sentiment?
* Was there any change on the topics addressed overtime-related to Migration?
* Is NLP a great tool to evaluate media especially concerning practical topics like migration?
