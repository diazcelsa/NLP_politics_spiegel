# NLP_politics_spiegel

Natural Language Processing analysis on Der Spiegel archive articles from the last 3 years.

The idea is to study the topic of MIGRATION and analyze how media has been treating the topic
* Was there any change on the vocabulary used over the last years?
* Was there any change on the sentiment of the topic?

In the current repository you will find:
* Topic related articles extraction
* TF-IDF grid search for parameter optimization with customize metrics for the optimization
* Visualization of most common normalized words over time in the topic
* Sentiment analysis of migration selected articles per quarter
